## Junebug

# C++ game engine for high performance game prototyping

C++ is performant, but it's not easy to use. Junebug takes that performance and wraps it in various abstractions to make it easy to use. The goal is to make a stand in replacement for Game Maker Studio 2 that can scale to the needs of a production game.
