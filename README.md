## Junebug

# C++ game engine for high performance game prototyping

C++ is performant, but it's not easy to use. Junebug takes that performance and wraps it in various abstractions to make it easy to use. The goal is to make a stand in replacement for Game Maker Studio 2 that can scale to the needs of a production game.

## Engine Features

-   [] Entity Component System
-   [] Full sprite transformations (rotation, scale, etc.)
-   [] OpenGL 3.3+ rendering
-   [] Web support (via Emscripten)
-   [] iOS support (via Metal)
-   [] Android support (via Vulkan)

## Included Implementations

-   [] Tilemaps
-   [] Parallax backgrounds
-   [] A\* pathfinding
-   [] Lots of math utilities

## Known Bugs
- Resizing the window breaks rendering
